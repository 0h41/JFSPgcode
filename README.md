# Just F***ing Start Printing
Custom start gcode for Bambu Lab P1S 3d printer.

**This code assumes that the printer is properly calibrated and homed, and the Z axis is not too close to the nozzle beforehand. DO NOT USE IT OTHERWISE!**

If you used stock start gcode for a succesfull print and the printer was kept powered, you should be good to go. IF YOU ARE NOT SURE IF THE PRINTER KEPT POWER, DON'T USE THIS!

Creating this gcode was motivated by the need to print thin, wide prints that are fast, but take the whole print bed.
Without this, calibration took longer than printing and a lot of filament was wasted on purges.
Print quality should stay the same as your print with stock gcode you just did, unless you do something that will make your homing/calibration obsolete.
Light ooze from the nozzle before printing should not be a big problem, as it should just stick to the purge line.

ONCE AGAIN, FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS CAPABLE OF IT, DON'T USE IT!
